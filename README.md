# UFOs

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of one technical analysis deliverable and a written report. You will submit the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to update a previously created web app that filtered UFO sightings by date with additional filters using date, city, state, country, and shape as criteria to enable more in depth analysis.  The following deliverables were required.
  1. Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
  2. Provide a written analysis with one drawback of the design and suggestions for further development
